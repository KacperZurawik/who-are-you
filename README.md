# WhoAreYou — Console App in C#

This is a simple console app written in C# as part of a homework assignment.  
The app asks the user for their name, birth date, and place of birth, then shows a short sentence with their name, age and place of birth.

## About

Even though the task was very basic, I made the project a bit more advanced on purpose.  
I wanted to reinforce my understanding of:
- creating and using models,
- separating logic into services,
- using a simple layered structure.

I also used this project to:
- refresh how console apps work in C#,
- go back to basics and practice core skills,
- add something extra from myself.

## Features

- Simple text-based menu interface
- Collects user input
- Calculates age using full birthdate (year, month, day)

## Future Improvements

- Make age calculation more precise by including day and month of birth.
- Refactor into multiple classes (User model, service layer)
- Add input validation

## Technologies

- .NET Framework 4.7.2
- C#
- Console Application

I am aware there is room for improvement in both structure and validation, but for now I am keeping it as-is — the app works, and done is better than perfect.
